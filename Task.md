## Project: Job Posting Scraper

## Requirements:

- Install the Beautiful Soup library using pip: pip install beautifulsoup4

- Define the target job board website.

- Identify the HTML elements that contain the job postings' information, such as job title, company name, location, and description.

- Create a Python script that utilizes Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML content of the job board website and extract the relevant information from each job posting.

- Implement a data storage mechanism to store the extracted information, such as a CSV file or a database.

- Organize the extracted data in a clear and structured manner, such as displaying the job title, company name, location, and description in separate columns.

- Refactor the web scraper into a reusable function that takes the URL of the job board page as input.

- Enhance the scraper to handle multiple pages of job postings and limit the number of requests to avoid overloading the server.
